# Kickstarter-Trend-Analysis
Analysis of different Status of campaigns per category and sub-category and also Status Analysis of campaigns based on year and category
In this project, I Analyzed a spreadsheet with thousands of rows and create pivot tables and charts to see the relationship between different factors and the status of the campaigns and evaluated what factors play principal roles for a campaign to be successful.
I Evaluated the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns by creating a summary statistics table and measure the variabilityÂ of the data.
