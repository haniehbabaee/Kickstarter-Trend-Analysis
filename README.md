# Kickstarter-Trend-Analysis

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will 
I organized and analyzed a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.I evaluated the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns by creating a summary statistics table and measure the variabilityÂ of the data.

By analyzing data with Excel, the question below are answered:
Part 1: Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
     1. Most of the Kickstarter campaigns are in the US.
     2. All the Kickstarter campaigns in the fields of Documentary and Rock Music are being successful.
     3. In December, the number of campaigns decreases. Successful and failed campaigns count tend to be equal.
 
Part 2: What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. There is no indication of ROI (Return of Investment) for each campaign.
2.      what percentage of the total campaign cost will be covered by the pledged amount.
3.      There is no information regarding who is behind each campaign so there can be data about the success rate of that person or group and relation to the future success of their other campaigns.
 
 
Part3: What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1.      Trends of the number of applications per year for Kickstarters.
2.  A table that summarizes goals and pledged for failed projects per category: This will show at what stage different campaign categories usually fail, so Kickstarter can adopt the goal, based on that.
